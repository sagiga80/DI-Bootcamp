    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to **learn from data**, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task. It is crucial in **data analytics** because it automates complex decision-making processes, uncovers hidden insights in data, and enables predictive modeling.\n"
