# Challenge 1: Sorting
# Write a Python program that takes a single string of words as input, where the words are separated by commas (e.g., ‘apple,banana,cherry’).
# The program should output these words sorted in alphabetical order, with the sorted words also separated by commas.
# Use the input() function to get a string of words from the user.
# The words will be separated by commas.
# Step 2: Split the String
# Step 3: Sort the List
# Step 4: Join the Sorted List
# Step 5: Print the Result
# Print the resulting comma-separated string.

# Expected Output:
# If the input is without,hello,bag,world, the output should be bag,hello,without,world.


# Challenge 2: Longest Word
# Write a function that takes a sentence as input and returns the longest word in the sentence. If there are multiple longest words, return the first one encountered.
# Characters like apostrophes, commas, and periods should be considered part of the word.
# Define a function that takes a string (the sentence) as a parameter.


# Step 2: Split the Sentence into Words
# Step 3: Initialize Variables
# Step 4: Iterate Through the Words
# Step 5: Compare Word Lengths
# Step 6: Return the Longest Word

# Expected Output:
# longest_word("Margaret's toy is a pretty doll.") should return "Margaret's".
# longest_word("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") should return "forever.".
# longest_word("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") should return "Forgetfulness".
