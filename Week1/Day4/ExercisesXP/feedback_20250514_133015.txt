suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, add input validation to handle non-integer or out-of-range inputs more gracefully.  Currently, it only prints an error message and doesn't prevent the function from continuing to run with potentially unexpected results.
- In Exercise 7, the bonus sections (floating-point temperatures and season-based temperatures) are implemented separately rather than integrated.  It would be better to combine these into a single, more comprehensive `get_random_temp()` function.
- Exercise 7's `main()` function could be improved by separating the temperature generation and advice-giving logic into separate functions to enhance readability and modularity.
- Add docstrings to functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values. This improves readability and maintainability.
- Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., instead of `names` use `magician_names` in Exercise 6).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the core functionality of all exercises, fulfilling the stated requirements.  Exercise 4 lacks input validation, and Exercise 7's bonus features are implemented separately instead of being combined, leading to a slight deduction.
- readability: The code is generally readable, but some improvements can be made.  More descriptive variable names and better separation of concerns (as suggested for Exercise 7) would enhance readability.  The addition of docstrings would also improve it significantly.
- performance: The code's performance is good. There are no obvious inefficiencies in the algorithms or data structures used. The random number generation and other operations are efficient.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in the code.  The code only deals with simple input and output and does not interact with external systems or handle sensitive data.
