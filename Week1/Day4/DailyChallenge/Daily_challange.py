# Daily challenge: Solve the Matrix
# Goal: Decrypt a hidden message from a matrix string by processing it column-wise and filtering characters.


# Instructions:

# You are given a “Matrix” string:



# MATRIX_STR = '''
# 7ii
# Tsx
# h%?
# i #
# sM 
# $a 
# #t%'''       


# This represents a grid of characters, and your task is to decode the hidden message within.



# Understanding the Matrix:

# Imagine this string arranged in rows and columns, forming a grid.
# To work with it in Python, you’ll need to transform this string into a 2D list (a list of lists), where each inner list represents a row.


# Step 1: Transforming the String into a 2D List



# Step 2: Processing Columns

# Neo reads the matrix column by column, from top to bottom, starting from the leftmost column.
# You’ll need to write code that iterates through the columns of your 2D list.
# Think about how you can access the elements of a 2D list by column.


# Step 3: Filtering Alpha Characters

# only select alpha characters (letters).
# For each character in a column, check if it’s an alpha character.
# If it is, add it to a temporary string.
# Think about how you can check if a character is an alphabet letter.


# Step 4: Replacing Symbols with Spaces

# Replace every group of symbols (non-alpha characters) between two alpha characters with a space.
# After you have gathered the alpha characters, you will need to iterate through them, and where there are non alpha characters between them, you will insert a space.
# Think about how you can keep track of when you encounter an alphabet character, and when you encounter a non alphabet character.


# Step 5: Constructing the Secret Message

# Combine the filtered and processed characters to form the decoded message.
# Print the decoded message.


# Example:



# MATRIX_STR = '''
# 7ii
# Tsx
# h%?
# i #
# sM 
# $a 
# #t%''' 

# # Step 1: Convert matrix_string to a 2D list (matrix)
# matrix = []
# # ... code to create matrix ...

# # Step 2: Iterate through columns
# # ... code to iterate through columns ...

# # Step 3: Filter alpha characters
# # ... code to filter alpha characters ...

# # Step 4: Replace symbols with spaces
# decoded_message = ""
# # ... code to replace symbols with spaces ...

# # Step 5: Print the decoded message
# print(decoded_message)
