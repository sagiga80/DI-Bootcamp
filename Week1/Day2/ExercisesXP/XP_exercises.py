# 🌟 Exercise 3: List Manipulation
# You have a list: basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
# Remove "Banana" from the list.
# Remove "Blueberries" from the list.

# 🌟 Exercise 5: For Loop
# Write a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.
# Write another for loop that prints every number from 1 to 20 where the index is even.

for i in range(1,21):
    print(i)
print("\n")
for i in range(1,21):
    if i%2:
        print(i)

# 🌟 Exercise 6: While Loop
# Write a while loop that keeps asking the user to enter their name.
# Stop the loop if the user’s input is your name.

my_name="sagi"
user_input=""
while user_input!=my_name:
    user_input=input("Please enter your name:\t")
    user_input=user_input.lower()
print("We have the same name!")

# Stop the loop when the user types 'quit'.
# For each topping entered, print:
# "Adding [topping] to your pizza."
# After exiting the loop, print all the toppings and the total cost of the pizza.
# The base price is $10, and each topping adds $2.50.

# 🌟 Exercise 10: Sandwich Orders
# Using the list:
# sandwich_orders = ["Tuna", "Pastrami", "Avocado", "Pastrami", "Egg", "Chicken", "Pastrami"]
