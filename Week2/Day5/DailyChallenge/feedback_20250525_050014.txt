suggestions for improvement:
- The answers to Exercise 1 are good but could be more precise and detailed. For example, the answer to encapsulation should mention data hiding and access modifiers.
- The code correctly implements a `Deck` class without inheriting from a `Card` class, fulfilling the Exercise 2 requirements. The use of list comprehensions for card creation is efficient and readable. 
- Add error handling or a check to make sure the deck is not empty before dealing a card to avoid potential `IndexError`.
Correctness: 90%
